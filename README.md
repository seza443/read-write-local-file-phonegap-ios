# read-write-local-file-phonegap-ios

**The interesting part is in [app.js](https://github.com/seza443/read-write-local-file-phonegap-ios/blob/master/www/js/app.js)**

Little test app to read and write a local file on iOS and Android using cordova (Phonegap) 
with the [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) using the sidemenu placeholder app.

On iOS, the file is saved under the "Documents" folder of the app's private folder.

On Android, it is saved at the root of the sdcard.

Thanks to [this repo](https://gist.github.com/alunny/1904992) for the example.
